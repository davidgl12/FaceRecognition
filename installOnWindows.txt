Required installation and dependencies for usage in Windows:

Of course you need python

1. Install OpenCV:

        pip install opencv-python

    Examples of OpenCV for face detection:
        https://realpython.com/face-recognition-with-python/ 
        https://realpython.com/face-detection-in-python-using-a-webcam/

2. Install Anaconda in order to install dlib (You don't need Anaconda to get dlib on linux):
        https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

3. Now you can install dlib (you need to previously create a virtual environment in conda using this command: conda create virenv):
        conda install -c conda-forge dlib

to use dblid you need to activate the anaconda virtual environment:
        conta activate virenv   //virenv is the name of the virtual environment
then you can run the code and include dlib library in your python projects, like in the examples

4. Then install the face_recognition library:
        pip install face_recognition
